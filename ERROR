   I made a an autograder test for Basics3 and I am passing the test.
However, I am getting an assertion error when I run this test on my implementation
of ShortestPath.

   I believe that my implementation of ShortestPath works and I pass all other
tests. However I think that this is not the full implmentation of A* Algorithm
and I actually visit Vertex 6.

6
1) TestSimpleShortPath(graph.PathsTesting)
    Assertion failed
    at graph.PathsTesting.TestSimpleShortPath:61 (PathsTesting.java)

P.S. Are we required to implement A* ? Because my implementation looks good to me.

Thank you very much.
